            </div>
            <p>Cities and nations the world over are opening up their data sets for unlimited use. Hong Kong has its own initiative with Data.One, and now there's a hackathon to prove it. At the Make.01 hackathon we'll build social and technical innovations with open data. Think food poisoning alerts on OpenRice, info-graphics on the conglomerates, or mapping urban flows. Think about the process of getting from data source to data consumption. From data glut, to data utility. But most of all, think of how your community will benefit from real-time, structured data, and build it at Make.01.</p>

                    <!-- <h2>Concept</h2> -->
                    <p>Open Data is the idea that certain data (non-personal) should be freely available to everyone to use and republish as they wish, without restrictions from copyright, patents or other control mechanisms. The value of this idea is that it improves transparency (What are my taxes being spent on?), it can optimize existing industries (What should hospitals specialize in?), or create new ones (How do public transport providers get me from A to B?).</p>
                    <p>At Make.01 we'll write applications, liberate data, create visualizations and publish analyses using open data to show support for and encourage the adoption of open data policies.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Who is this for?</h3>
                    <p>Developers get crafty at hackathons, service designers have their 'Global Jam', Data Scientists route cars at Traffic Camp, and entrepreneurs launch ideas over a StartUp Weekend. For many disciplines and niches, there are events where over the course of the weekend attendees learn about or develop something in their niche. Make.01 is all that, but isn't restricted or reducible to a formula like 'Business + Design + Technology'.
                    <p>Open Data can be sourced and built on in any domain or industry, so this event is open to anyone who has an idea for using open data, wants to find an interesting project to contribute towards, learn about how to visualize or analyse data or simply want to see what's happening.</p>
                    <p>OpenData is a truly cross-disciplinary affair so that's why we expect that Developers, Statisticians, Journalists, Designers, and Citizens alike will each contribute their skills to the projects at Make.01</p>
                    <img class="col-image" src="http://assets.okfn.org/images/data-types.png">
                    <h3>How will it work?</h3>
                    <p>Make.01 is a weekend where people with complementary skill-sets team up to make with and for Open Data. We'll hold a Catalyst night on the Tuesday before the event, so all participants are introduced to each other and everyone gets a chance to pitch their project ideas for the weekend.</p>
                    <p>We'll do some complex number crunching and people polling and come up with a list of projects which have sufficient people behind them to be feasibly made over a weekend. Projects can be merged if sufficiently similar. People are then free to join the teams of their choosing. We'll do a final round to confirm which projects have teams rallied behind them. To accommodate those projects which are one-person/few hours projects, we'll keep the schedule flexible, and spread them over the course of the weekend.</p>
                    <p>You'll be able to submit and review project proposals on this page as soon as the submission system goes live.</p>
                    <p>Between the catalyst night and the weekend, makers will have the opportunity to sharpen their pencils, setup their development environments, and generally get the more mundane setup stage over with prior to the event.</p>
                    <p>Over the weekend the teams will work on their respective projects. Since some projects will be completed within hours, and some short-trackers only have day-tickets, some people will work on multiple projects with multiple teams over the weekend. It'll depend on the projects and teams however whether they can accommodate late members. Be sure to join at least join one team before coming on the weekend. At times we'll check in with the teams and have little presentation rounds to see where everyone's at and make sure no-one is stuck.</p>
                    <p>During a final round of presentations every team will get to show off and discuss their project. Though participation in Make.01 is primarily for self-fulfilment, several Raspberry Pis have been made available to be awarded to the most successful project. Success is a popularity contest! Participants get to vote for their favourite project.</p>

                <h3>Catalyst Night</h3>
                <h4>Tuesday, 14 May @ The Good Lab</h4>
                <p>The Catalyst night is a precursor to Make.01 where participants propose their projects and form teams. We poll interest for each suggested project - you can propose as many as you like - and cull the ones which have too few supporters.</p>
                <p>We'll end with a solid set of feasible projects that have sufficient backers to be completed over the weekend. As some project may take fewer people and less time to complete, we'll also try to come up with a sensible schedule for spreading them out over the weekend. Anyone got a fancy algorithm for that?</p>
                <p>For the uninitiated - that'd be all of us really - we'll have a primer on the scope of Open Data and delineate what sorts of issues and applications you can address at Make.01. We'll also introduce you to some of Hong Kong's OpenData datasets, tools and applications currently available.</p>
                <p>The catalyst night is held earlier on in the week so you can take care of the more mundane preparations before Make.01 (e.g. printing templates, setting up a development environment, setting on a tool chain) and just spend the weekend making.</p>

                <p>The first day of Make.01 is spent laying the ground-work for your projects. Convene at the GoodLab at noon and get your creative juices flowing! Before dinner, we'll get together to hear how each project is developing. Each team delivers a short, 2 minute presentation on where they are at, and what challenges they're facing.</p>
                <p>To make sure everyone gets to their accommodation in time, we close shop half an hour before the last MTR passes by Cheung Sha Wan.</p>

                <p>On the second day of Make.01 we'll work against the clock and polish our prototypes/designs/apps for the final round of presentations at 17:15.</p>
                <p>If a full weekend is too much of a commitment, short track (1 day) tickets are also available. Sunday is the recommended day for short trackers to participate as it's still possible to present the project at day's end. The established teams will also bring the short trackers up to speed on their progress so they can possibly join them.</p>

There are short track tickets available if you can only make it on one of the days - preferably Sunday so you can still present at the final round of presentation. Some projects you're interested in will only take a day or less to build, so it's fine if you suggest and participate in projects that don't take up the whole weekend.

                        <p>We take a very broad definition of making. Any creative act where you devise and implement an idea falls within the purview of making. Making is as much about the practice of tinkering, playing with available tools and developing your own, as it is about building the end product.</p>
                        <p>Whether the result is thus a set of definitions, a icon-graphic language, a web entity, a physical object, or a friendly robot, you've <em>made</em> it if it came about through an iterative problem solving process where often the biggest challenge was to make everything work together. In sum, Making is ascending above the limitations of what you're given.</p>
                        <p>As long as you believe your project fits that description, it's feasible to deliver over a weekend, and is relevant to Open Data, then it's the perfect project for Make.01.</p>
