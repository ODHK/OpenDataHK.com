9	Reporting tool for Requests for Access to Information	Hong Kong does not have a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). It instead has a Code on Access to Information that stipulates that all Government Departments have Access to Information Officers and provides contact information, so they can provide data when it is requested. They have a form (not web-based) and no general streamlined process for accessing information.\r\nAs part of an attempt to further inform the public about important information that people want to know, we could build a simple form to record requests, automatically email the request to the appropriate access officer and display information about the request for public viewing. We could also provide a way for updating the request, explaining whether it was properly fulfilled. Nothing like transparency to help know whether our Code works or not.	http://www.access.gov.hk/images/index.jpg	http://www.access.gov.hk/	2013-05-13 03:50:39.591497	2013-05-17 12:07:23.809126	development	ODHK	
11	Hong Kong food security and mainland's two standard on food quality	According to a report from USDA Foreign Agricultural Service, Hong Kong local\r\nproduction accounted for 2.5 percent of fresh vegetables, 56.2 percent of live poultry\r\nand 6.4 percent of live pigs that Hong Kongers daily consumed. Mainland China is its\r\none of its important food suppliers.\r\n\r\n\r\nHong Kong food security is a significant issue. With a low self-sufficiency, for one\r\nthing, once farming in mainland gets something wrong, such as pests or epidemic,\r\nHong Kongers would be influenced immediately and directly. For another, the\r\nsafety level of mainland food is in decline under the media’s intense coverage. So, is\r\nmainland food sold in Hong Kong safe?\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there is something wrong with the supply chain, that’s a big scandal for Hong\r\nKong government. If there is nothing wrong with the food imported from mainland,\r\ncitizens in mainland may feel unfair about the “gap” between domestic production\r\nand exported ones.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe government and public have raised their expectation on food quality in mainland\r\nwith the country’s rapid development; however, many horrible food scandals make\r\nmainland people scared about food safety. It seems that mainland health authorities\r\nattach great importance to food for export, but looses the control on domestic ones.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe food safety control system of Hong Kong is quite different from mainland one,\r\ncreating China’s double standards for exported food to Hong Kong and domestic\r\nconsumed ones. That’s also an interesting point to find out what's the detailed\r\ndifference within the double standards.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Centre for Food Safety Department of Hong Kong government had specific\r\nregulations on different food imported from mainland, including chilled chickens,\r\nfrozen confections, milk and milk beverages, marine products. I will compare each\r\nspecific standard on food quality with mainland’s corresponding one.\r\n\r\n\r\nData can be used:\r\n\r\n1. Mainland food condition in Hong Kong.\r\n\r\n2. The standard of import control and food safety guideline in Hong Kong.\r\n\r\n3. Standard of food quality on domestic market production in mainland.\r\n\r\n4. Hong Kong food imports rate, and where are different types of food mainly\r\nfrom.\r\n\r\n5. Money involved in food trade between Mainland China and Hong\r\nKong (trade and industry department)\r\n\r\n6. Hong Kong food self-sufficiency rate.\r\n\r\nThe format will be the print version with infographics.\r\n\r\n\r\nClips summary\r\n\r\nI cannot find much credible media covering on this issue, and most relevant stories\r\npublished come from anti-community website, like EPOCH Times.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.5food.cn/news/show-9191.html\r\n\r\nThis clip is talking about China hold different food safety standards for domestic\r\nproductions and exported ones.\r\n\r\nhttp://genascihk.com/2011/03/12/many-hong-kong-vegetables-contaminated-with-\r\nheavy-metals/\r\nThis clip is talking about Hong Kong vegetables, mostly imported from the mainland,\r\ncontain high levels of lead and traces of other metals, including cadmium, which may\r\nrelate to a scandal in mainland about 12 million tons of Chinese rice are contaminated\r\nwith heavy metals.

19	SoundProof	“Renovation is recreational activity in this city” – Xu Xi, from Evanescent Isles\r\n\r\nExposure to noise from construction is a daily experience for most Hong Kong people. From new buildings to renovations to road widening and resurfacing, it is difficult to walk one city block without passing at least one of these kinds of construction. Many people complain about construction noise and scientific research has established that noise exposure has negative effects on human health. It has been linked to depression, sleep problems, blood pressure and cardiovascular disease. \r\nConstruction Noise in Hong Kong is controlled by the 1989 (CAP400) Noise Control Ordinance. The Ordinance requires builders to apply for permits and restricts construction noise to the hours of 07:00 to 19:00 Monday to Saturday. There are extra restrictions for percussive piling. Most Hong People know that these restrictions are regularly and sometimes routinely flouted.\r\nThere is data available on the Environmental Protection Department’s website on all construction noise permits currently in force (searchable by district). It may be possible to request information for future permits too.  The Department of Justice would record numbers of convictions for breaches of the ordinance and details of when and where they occurred.\r\nA Hong Kong construction noise website could present a live map of current construction sites, as well as informing about upcoming construction. The site could include information about the related health issues and personal measures one could take to minimise negative effects. There could be information about how to make a noise complaint, and a ‘name and shame’ list of those caught in breach of the legislation. \r\n\r\nClip Summary\r\nWhile there are several academic papers on the issue, there is surprisingly little coverage of the issue in the media, considering how often Hong Kong people talk about it.\r\n\r\nWhat?

The index must be weighted and can havesub indices which are combined mathematically weighted to form the final index. A higher index is better. Two cities of different size with different population should yield similar index value for "same openness".\r\n\r\nEach city compared should be programmatically evaluated by a web and api crawl usage spec yielding automatic recomputation of the index.\r\n\r\nThe index should be an ongoing project with improving metrics and possibly increasing values as new components are added to the evaluation.	http://webservices.ahc.ufl.edu/files/2011/07/analytics.jpg		2013-05-13 09:48:38.856972	2013-05-17 14:36:48.587155	shelved	ODHK

21	Construction: Hong Kong's most dangerous job?	The sound of construction is inescapable in Hong Kong. The construction industry accounts for more than 3% of Hong Kong’s GDP and in the next few years, public infrastructure expenditure is estimated to exceed HK$70 billion annually.\r\n\r\nBut construction continues to be the most dangerous industry in Hong Kong. In 2012, 24 construction workers died, the same number as in 2002. In 2011, the number of accidents for every 100,000 workers was 54 – more than five times the rate in Singapore, Japan and South Korea.\r\n\r\nStatistics provided by the Labour Department can be used to show how construction accidents and fatalities have changed over time, and how the construction industry compares to other industries. \r\n\r\nHong Kong’s media also reports on construction accidents. The details of these articles could be used in conjunction with the Labour Department’s statistics to map the location and nature of construction accidents in recent years. \r\n\r\nThis is the ideal time to report about construction accidents as Construction Safety Week is scheduled for 27 – 31 May, 2013. Hong Kong Occupational Safety and Health Assocciation’s Annual Safety Conference will take place on 28 May.	http://www4.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Bamboo+Scaffolding+Used+Construction+Hong+Yw5AX1ncUoBl.jpg		2013-05-14 07:42:08.566721	2013-05-14 07:42:08.566721	proposal	ODHK	\N
23	The Toll of Cross Harbour Tunnels in Hong Kong	The congestion of cross harbour tunnels is always a big problem for the costal metropolis Hong Kong. The Hong Kong government has tried different ways to solve this problem, and increasing the toll fees is one of the solutions. In 2013 Hong Kong Policy Address, the government suggests increasing the toll fees for the Cross Harbour Tunnel and reducing those for the Eastern Harbour Crossing through government subsidy, in order to ease the congestion of Cross Harbour Tunnel. In February and April, the panels of transport have been held to discuss this issue. \r\n\r\nThis investigation aims to discuss whether increasing the toll fees can ease the congestion of traffic. We will try to find the relationship between toll fee and frequency of usage through some previous increases of toll fees of tunnels. For example, the tolls fees of Western Harbour Crossing have increased since January 1st, 2013. \r\n\r\nMany data materials can be used in this investigation. \r\n1. Journey time indicators (from HK Datasets)\r\n•\thttp://www.gov.hk/en/theme/psi/datasets/journeytime.htm\r\n•\tSource: XML\r\n•\tDescription: Average journey time for major roads in Hong Kong (including cross-harbour)\r\nThis data can show the traffic situation of each tunnel. \r\n2. Data from Western Harbour Crossing\r\nWe can request to get the statistics of frequency before and after the increase of tolls. It can be a reference of whether the tolls will affect divers’ choice of route. \r\n3. Data from HK Transport Department\r\nWe can request to know how many times the tolls of cross habour tunnel have been increased and related statistics, such as increase rates and frequency of usage. \r\n\r\nClip research:\r\n1.

17	How much is Hong Kong throwing away?	Domestic waste has always been of public concern and with the government looking to expand the its environmental levy scheme on plastic shopping bags, this story looks at how effective the scheme has been since it was introduced four years ago and how much Hong Kong people are still throwing away. Have Hong Kong people created less waste since then, and how is that reflected in the city’s almost-full landfills? Since the levy has been in force, reusable shopping bags made with thicker plastic and non-woven bags have become more common. How are they impacting the environment as they take longer time to degenerate? What can we do to minimise waste?\r\n\r\nThe Environmental Protection Department offers clear statistics of Hong Kong domestic plastic waste from 1997 to 2011, which also give a breakdown on how much of that plastic bags account for. The Legislative Council brief submitted by the department for this expansion also gives statistics related to plastic bag usage and waste. This story will reveal how effective the plastic bag levy scheme has been, as the government pushes the expansion plan to the Legislative Council this week. \r\n	http://www.hkcleanup.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/2006818_f520.jpg		2013-05-14 04:07:34.436363	2013-05-17 14:35:35.881221	development	ODHK

18	What will happen to pollution in HK if the US economy recovers?	According to the Hong Kong government's Environmental Protection Department great strides have been made in fighting pollution in the Pearl River Delta. But this has coincided with a manufacturing slowdown in China because of the weak US economy. With the US now showing signs of recovery, what will happen to pollution here?	http://www.epd.gov.hk/epd/english/images/cur_iss/prd_aqms.gif		2013-05-14 04:15:21.10325	2013-05-20 09:01:41.688737	development	ODHK	
24	Travel Agent in Mainland China	1.\tStory idea: In 2012, China became the largest tourists exporting country in the world over US, with spending nearly 102 billion on travelling abroad, according to World Tourism Organization (WTO). This booming travel market urged the development of travel agents. The numbers of China’s travel agents increased from 7,326 to 21,649 in 2002-2012 with 10.35% annual growth rate. However, more than 95% of China’s travel agents are small, scattered and weak, waging price wars with each other in a low profit rate. In 2012, the total revenue of 5,000 Chinese domestic travel agents approximately equaled to the revenue of American Express. \r\n2.\tData Source: China Tourism Statistical Bulletin; China Star Hotel Statistical Bulletin; Industry Analysis Report by consultant company; Financial statements of listed travel agents; Academic journals by researchers.\r\n3.\tClip search: the previous research tend to attribute the fragmented market to the historical closed-door policy of China’s government. It’s only the partial truth. Actually it is the current outdated government supervision policy that resulted in this deformed market. It required each travel agent to build up its entire function departments including flight and hotel booking, ticket booking, tours design, travel guide training, product sales and so on, instead of encouraging subdivision of industry chain, which is widely used in U.S. and European travel agent industry.\r\n4.\tThe medium of the story – print, info graphic. This is an analytical article mainly basic on data and policy comparison. So infographic is most helpful.	http://www.sdtravel.cn/luxingshe/P1010022.JPG		2013-05-15 10:07:12.346055	2013-05-15 10:07:12.346055	proposal	ODHK	\N
26	GeoComm	Most projects are focussing on how we can use open data to create. This project is about how we can _create_ open data. \r\n\r\nIt's a mobile app that plugs into the phones various sensors and is able to push a measurement - to report - to a geodata set provider.  A lot of Make.01 projects  [Light Pollution](http://opendatahk.com/projects/12), [Construction Noise](http://opendatahk.com/projects/19), [Construction Fatalities](http://opendatahk.com/projects/21), rely on crowd-sourced geospatial data, and all could benefit from a crowd sourced reporting app.\r\n\r\nDevelopers of this app can work in collaboration with the [GeoDex](http://opendatahk.com/projects/25) team to decide on an interoperable format so the GeoComm can submit its data to the maps that the GeoDex displays! \r\n\r\nPossible tech stack :\r\n\r\n* Android SDK	http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110927143412/memoryalpha/en/images/c/cd/Communications_pack.jpg		2013-05-16 03:33:21.826088	2013-05-16 03:36:22.975726	proposal	ODHK	\N
2	Taxi Driver Ratings	The internet lets you rate a lot of things: restaurants, apps, movies, asses. And now there’s one more service that you can evaluate – thanks to the new TaxiCrab app – but that’s for Shanghai taxi drivers. In Hong Kong there are plenty of maniacal taxi drivers I wish I could warn others about. 	http://www.techinasia.com/techinasia/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/rate-your-taxi-driver.jpg		2013-05-12 19:10:33.875957	2013-05-17 12:06:04.748155	shelved	ODHK	
5	Opening Data	Bill & Michael will work on this on Saturday | Haggen worked on Sunday  \r\n\r\nIdentify open data sets in HK not listed on the HKGov Data.One site. \r\nSome of these may be available but with restrictions. \r\nHow to identify? \r\nHow to evaluate?\r\n\r\nGoal: Made a form so people can suggest datasets on HK government websites they have discovered that they believe should be part of Data.One or scraped.  Included the 16 areas identified by the World Bank's Open Data Readiness Assessment (ODRA) tool as guides, see page 20 here <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-bx-NcO9dXXQ2QyMWoyenI2OVE/edit" title=World_Bank_Data_Tool_Document target="_blank">here</a>  \r\n\r\nWork done exclusively by Michael and Haggen: \r\n<br>Created a Google form to collect possible datasets ~ this is a crowdsourcing.  \r\n<br>Linked it to Facebook. \r\n<br>Where to host this site? Will see about putting it up on opendatahk.com   \r\n<br>How to promote? \r\n\r\nThis page lists datasets which are not in Data.One Website\r\nhttp://openingdata2-michaelchan.rhcloud.com/DatasetReported.php\r\n\r\nThe form for submitting Datasets found\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/1YBy6Smz2EJ4zL3ncrE0I5grP0eqemgsHZK6UIyVlagw/viewform\r\n\r\nThe spreadsheet of the datasets listed\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AhnvMyekm5G8dHNmLWFxRzZJeTVtZVNRUmVLX2RDZXc#gid=0\r\n	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/Col-Johnson-Liberating-an-Unfortunate-Debtor.jpg		2013-05-12 19:24:30.701433	2013-05-25 06:34:03.153524	development	ODHK	
25	GeoDex	GeoDex is a frontend framework to display and interact with open geodata. A lot of open data sets include geocoded assets. The Hong Kong Gov provides geo-referenced data (including names, addresses and co-ordinates, etc.) of 79 types of public facilities such as government offices, hospitals, schools, country parks, GovWiFi premises as well as recreational, cultural and sports venues. \r\n\r\nThis data already [has a map](http://www2.map.gov.hk/gih3/view/index.jsp), but its information architecture severely limits it functionality: you can't link directly to a dataset or view, you can't share a Point of Interest, you can't add your own points.\r\n\r\nAll of these shortcomings would be addressed in GeoDex. We'll use an off-the shelf mapping framework, but the UI provides additional functionality that open data sets commonly leverage.\r\n\r\n1. **Display**: present geospatial metadata in a dedicated info panel.\r\n1. **Report**:  allow users to add to the dataset, both privately and in public. \r\n1. **Share**: allow users to share points of interest and map views on popular Social Networks\r\n1. **Customise**: allow users to modify their views by mashing and filtering datasets. \r\n\r\nPossible tech stacks:\r\n\r\n* MongoDB\r\n* AngularJS\r\n* Express\r\n* NodeJS\r\n* LeafletJS\r\n\r\nor \r\n\r\n* MongoDB\r\n* Rails\r\n* AngularJS\r\n* LeafletJS	http://www.upokecenter.com/dex/rbyarea.png		2013-05-16 03:16:43.310327	2013-05-17 12:08:14.058169	development	ODHK	GeoDex

28	Hong Kong Food Poisoning Map	Hong Kong has some of the most varied eating experiences available in Asia.  The food can be cheap and great...or expensive and terrible.  The worst is when the food makes you SICK.\r\n\r\nOne of the real and present dangers of eating out in Hong Kong is the reality that food poisoning is endemic.  Partially because it is hot, compressed and a highly competitive F&B environment, partially because refrigeration, hygiene and food handling safety aren't always at the top of the priority list.  \r\n\r\nIt is a fact that Hong Kong long-time residents and natives are philosophical about this and have resigned themselves to the fact that there is a 1 in X chance that eating out will make you sick.  \r\n\r\nReduce your own personal 1 in X by eating out in an informed way.  Contribute to our HK FOOD POISONING MAP project where web-sourced, government and user contributed data will be used to dynamically update a graphical map of Hong Kong, showing in near real-time which eateries you need to avoid!\r\n\r\nSimilar in spirit to projects in \r\n\r\nNew York City:\r\n\r\nhttp://donteat.at/\r\n\r\nand Toronto:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.thegridto.com/life/food-drink/toronto-food-safety/\r\n\r\nThe Hong Kong Food Poisoning Map proposes to integrate and cross-reference existing web based sources of information (ex:  open rice) with government data (when they give it to us) along with crowd-sourced (and social media validated) user-supplied data to generate the most accurate, up-to-date picture of where NOT to eat in Hong Kong!\r\n\r\n	http://www.thegridto.com/wp-content/uploads/20120125-lead-closures.jpg		2013-05-17 15:14:52.654938	2013-05-20 09:01:48.817703	development	ODHK	HKFPM
